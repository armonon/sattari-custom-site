One big Dose knob escalates the whole thing so you can automate 'clean → chaos' in a single move.",
    how: "It's a chain of real DSP blocks scaled together by the Dose macro: a morphable formant filter (two resonators sweeping A-E-I-O-U) for talkbox/vowel warp; ring modulation against a tunable carrier for metallic robot tones; a waveshaper drive plus bit/sample-rate crush for grit and lo-fi; and a tempo-synced beat-repeat stutter that captures a slice and loops it.

The needle stays steady thanks to smoothing, and it locks to whatever reference you set — from concert 440 to 432 or period tunings — so it fits guitars, voice, brass, strings and synths alike.",
    how: "It mono-sums the incoming signal and runs the same YIN pitch tracker that powers Auto Pitch, folded to the octave and smoothed with a one-pole so the readout doesn't jitter. Detected frequency is converted to a fractional MIDI note against your chosen Reference A, then split into the nearest note plus a signed cents deviation that drives the needle and the green in-tune zone.

It generates two independent 'takes' of your voice, detuned a few cents, nudged a few milliseconds apart, and slowly drifting on their own — then pans them left and right around the dry centre. The result is the width and thickness of a real double without the chorus-y whoosh, and without re-recording.",
    how: "Each double runs through the suite's formant-preserving PSOLA shifter (the same engine behind Auto Pitch), so detuning never turns the voice into a whistle — the vocal-tract character stays intact. A YIN pitch tracker feeds the shifter the right grain spacing; a modulated delay adds the timing offset; and a slow random-walk drift keeps the two takes breathing independently so they never phase-lock. Doubles are added around the dry signal, panned by Width.",

Split mode reduces just the sibilant band so the rest of the vocal stays bright and open; Wideband mode ducks the whole signal for a classic broadband de-ess. A Listen switch solos the detection band so you can dial the frequency in by ear.",
    how: "It splits a high sibilance band out of the signal with a complementary high-pass, so the low band plus the sibilance band reconstruct the input exactly with no coloration when nothing is happening. A fast stereo-linked envelope follower watches that band; when it crosses the threshold, the band is ducked by up to the Range amount (in split mode) or the whole signal is ducked (wideband).

Push Formant up for a smaller, brighter, more feminine voice; pull it down for a larger, darker one; all while the melody stays exactly where it was. Move Pitch on its own for a formant-corrected transpose with no chipmunk effect, or move both for full transformation.",
    how: "It runs the suite's vendored Rubber Band R3 engine, which resynthesizes the signal with separate pitch and formant scaling — so the fundamental and the spectral envelope can be shifted by different amounts at the same time. A clean output FIFO (the same fix behind Auto Pitch's crackle) keeps it glitch-free, and the dry side of the Mix is delay-compensated so blends stay phase-aligned. Reported latency lets the host keep everything in time.",

Push Sustain to pull up room and body and make things longer; pull it down to tighten and dry them out. It reads the shape of the sound, not a fixed threshold, so it tracks dynamics naturally.",
    how: "It uses the classic differential-envelope method: two followers with different attack times give an ATTACK envelope that spikes on onsets, and two followers with different release times give a SUSTAIN envelope that rises through the tail. Both are normalised against a stable level estimate so the effect is level-independent, and detection is stereo-linked so the image stays put.

What sets it apart is that each bell can go dynamic: turn its Dyn up and the boost or cut only engages when that band is actually loud. That means you can tame a harsh 3 kHz peak or a boomy note only when it jumps out, without dulling the quiet passages — surgical control that reacts to the material.",
    how: "Each bell is an RBJ peaking filter with independent freq, gain and Q; the HPF and LPF are Butterworth. For dynamic bells, a bandpass detector at the band's frequency feeds an envelope follower, and the band's move is crossfaded in by how loud that band is — so at Dyn 0 it's a normal static EQ and at Dyn 1 the move engages only above the band's level.

    what: "Vocal hosts a ten-module roster for cleanup, gating, de-essing, EQ, compression, saturation, doubling, space, formant shaping and ensemble work. Vocal Studio fills all eight slots with the current production path; focused presets provide smaller starting points.",
    how: "The same module implementations power their standalone shells and the rack. The host resolves transport, sidechain and parameters once, then runs only the first active occurrence of each stateful module.",

    tagline: "Layer four instruments with splits, transposition and source loading.",
    what: "Stack renders instruments in parallel rather than chaining them. Each layer has its own level, pan, key range and transpose, so it can build unisons, octave layers and keyboard splits.",
    how: "Every layer owns independent DSP state and receives filtered MIDI. Layer latency is aligned to the slowest active instrument. Chop and Granulator sources can be loaded per layer and their paths persist with plugin state; module-type controls are explicitly shared.",
